# Space Owners
Data types, functions, conditional statements, loops, and object-oriented programming are just a few of
the key ideas in Python that the Applied Programming with Python course intends to cover in addition to
the fundamentals of programming. Using these ideas as a foundation, I created Space Owners, a space
shooting game that will bring back memories for anyone who has ever used a computer.


This will be a Python-based arcade game that is evocative of a number of early 1980s "shot 'em up" games.
The game's mechanics are highly dynamic, despite the fact that they were intended to be simple. The
game's gameplay is also intriguing. In order to capture some of the necessary OS features, the pygame
package and the os package are both widely utilized in this game. Below are some of the objectives behind
choosing this project idea:

- To challenge players with obstacles that they must defeat
- To give an immersive and interesting environment that represents space-related concepts
- To create a compelling gameplay experience for gamers.
